# Lesson 4: Assignments | Python Loop Statements
# 1. The Range Riddle
print()
# Task 1: Your Mood Today

# Example Outcome: An example output could be "On Wednesday, you were feeling happy." 
# "On Thursday you were feeling sad."
import random

moods = ["happy", "sad", "energetic", "calm", "tired"]
days = ['Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday','Friday','Saturday','Sunday']
for day in days:
    mood = random.choice(moods)
    print("On " + day + ", you were feeling " + mood + ".")

# 2. Double Scoop with Nested Loops
print()
# Task 1: Your Mood Tracker
times = ['morning','afternoon','night']
# Example Outcome: An example would be "On Tuesday afternoon 
# you were sad" "On Tuesday night you were happy" "On Wednesday morning you were tired"

        mood = random.choice(moods)
        print("On " + day + " " + time + ", you were feeling " + mood + ".")

# 3. Loop Condition Logic
print()
# Task 1: Loop Condition Exploration
# Write a while loop with a condition that will never be true (an infinite loop). 
# Inside the loop, print a statement. Then, use a break statement to exit the loop after 5 iterations.
i = 0
while True:
    print("Loopy...", i+1)
    i += 1
    if i == 5:
        break
# Task 2: Conditional Exit
print()
# Modify the infinite loop from Task 1 to include a condition that will eventually be true 
# and remove the break statement. The loop should terminate naturally once the condition is met.
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print("Loopy...", i+1)
    i += 1

# 4. Python's Random Game Night
print()
# Task 1: Random Choice Game
# Create a game where a player has a list of items. 
# They have to guess which item in the list was selected. 
# Use random.choice() to select the item and take the user's guess via input. 
# Provide feedback on whether they guessed correctly or not.

ltr = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J"]
secret_ltr = random.choice(ltr)
guess = input(f"Guess a letter from {ltr[0]} to {ltr[-1]}: ").upper()
guess_cnt = 1
while guess != secret_ltr:
    if ltr[0] <= guess <= ltr[-1]:  # Different message if guess NOT in Range
        msg = "high" if guess > secret_ltr else "low "
        guess = input(f"Guess was too {msg} (Guess Again): ").upper()
    else:
        guess = input(f"{guess} is OUT OF RANGE  (Guess Again): ").upper()
    guess_cnt += 1
print(f"\n  You guessed it in {guess_cnt} tries! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ¥³ \n") 

# 5. Looping Lists - The Rhythm of Repetition
# Task 1: The for Loop DJ Set
# Using the provided genres list, write a for loop that prints out each genre with a custom message.
# Extend this task by adding a counter that displays the number of the track before the genre.
# Our playlist of genres:
genres = ['Jazz', 'Rock', 'Hip-hop', 'Classical']

for i in range(len(genres)):
    print("Track", i+1, ": Now Playing", genres[i])
# Task 2: The Remix Artist with while
print()
# Convert the for loop from Task 1 into a while loop. Ensure it performs the same function 
# but also includes a condition to stop the loop if a certain genre is played for instance Hip-hop.
i = 0
while genres[i] != "Classical":
    print("Track", i+1, ": Now Playing", genres[i])
    i += 1
# Task 3: Light Show Technician Loop
print()
# Using the range() function, loop through the genres list by index.
# For each genre, print out the track number and a message that the light show is ready. 
# Modify the loop to skip a genre if it's not suitable for the light show, 
# for instance Classical genre.
for i in range(len(genres)):
    if genres[i] != "Classical":
        print("Track", i+1, ": Light show ready for", genres[i])

# 6. Advanced Looping 
print()
# Task 1: The Selective DJ
# Loop through a slice of the genres list from the previous question 
# and print out the genres. Use slicing to create a sublist of genres from the second
# to the fourth track.
for genre in genres[1:4]:
    print(genre)
# Task 2: The One-Liner Band with List Comprehensions
print()
# Use a list comprehension to create a new list that contains each genre 
# with the word "Music" appended to it. Print this new list.
comprehension = []
for genre in genres:
    comprehension.append(genre + " Music")
print(comprehension)
# Task 3: Numerical Beats with range
print()
# Write a loop using range() to print out a countdown from 10 to 1, 
# followed by the message "The beat drops now!".
for i in range(10, 0, -1):
  print(i)
print("The beat drops now!")
