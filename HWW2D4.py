3. Loop Condition Logic
Task 1: Loop Condition Exploration
Write a while loop with a condition that will never be true (an infinite loop). 
Inside the loop, print a statement. Then, use a break statement to exit the loop after 5 iterations.

Task 2: Conditional Exit
Modify the infinite loop from Task 1 to include a condition that will eventually be true 
and remove the break statement. The loop should terminate naturally once the condition is met.

4. Python's Random Game Night
Task 1: Random Choice Game
Create a game where a player has a list of items. They have to guess which item in the list was selected. 
Use random.choice() to select the item and take the user's guess via input. 
Provide feedback on whether they guessed correctly or not.

5. Looping Lists - The Rhythm of Repetition
Task 1: The for Loop DJ Set
Using the provided genres list, write a for loop that prints out each genre with a custom message.
Extend this task by adding a counter that displays the number of the track before the genre.
Our playlist of genres:

Task 2: The Remix Artist with while
Convert the for loop from Task 1 into a while loop. Ensure it performs the same function 
but also includes a condition to stop the loop if a certain genre is played for instance Hip-hop.

Task 3: Light Show Technician Loop
Using the range() function, loop through the genres list by index.

6. Advanced Looping
